    <h1>Hi, I'm Mateo</h1>
        <p>
            I'm 21, living in Texas. I have always had an interest in coding, having taken it through out middleschool and highschool. I decided on IT after realizing the amount of math that would be required from me for engineering. I'm not bad at math, but it is not something I really enjoy doing. On top of coding I really love to draw. I've been drawing for longer than I have coding, but I didn't want to make a career out of it because in my opinion that ruined the fun of it. While it's not exactly a job I do take art commissions from time-to-time.
